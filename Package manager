What is a package manager ?

Package managers are charged with the task of finding, installing, maintaining or uninstalling software packages upon the user's command.

A project dependency can be an entire JavaScript library or framework — such as React or Vue — or a very small utility like our human-readable date library,
or it can be a command line tool such as Prettier or ESLint, which we talked about in previous articles.

Without modern build tools, dependencies like this might be included in your project using a simple <script> element, but this might not work right out of the
box and you will likely need some modern tooling to bundle your code and dependencies together,when they are released on the web. 

 #A bundle is the term that's generally used to refer to a single file on your web server that contains all the JavaScript for your software — typically
 compressed as much as possible to help reduce the time it takes to get your software downloaded and displayed in your visitors' browser.

 If you didn't use one, you'd have to manually handle:

Finding all the correct package JavaScript files.
Checking them to make sure they don't have any known vulnerabilities.
Downloading them and putting them in the correct locations in your project.
Writing the code to include the package(s) in your application (this tends to be done using JavaScript modules, another subject that is worth reading up on and understanding).
Doing the same thing for all of the packages' sub-dependencies, of which there could be tens, or hundreds.
Removing all the files again if you want to remove the packages.

all this should me done manually if no package manager is installed

To install a package manager [npm this time] : 

We use 
a. npm init -y [y use to skip all questioned asked ]
b. package.json will get in you directory that look like : 

{
  "name": "name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A simple npm package to learn about using npm",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Chris Mills",
  "license": "ISC"
}
